# Seven Bridges Tools and Workflows

The [Bioinformatics Shared Resource](https://uofuhealth.utah.edu/huntsman/shared-resources/gba/bioinformatics/) 
at the [Huntsman Cancer Institute](https://huntsmancancer.org/index.php) as licensed 
[Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/) for storing legacy and current genomic 
data and as a platform to enable investigators to enable their own bioinformatic analysis. 
See our Cloud computing [overview](https://uofuhealth.utah.edu/huntsman/shared-resources/gba/bioinformatics/cloud-storage/) 
for more information.

This repository is for custom tools and workflows developed by Bioinformatics Core. 
Since sharing tools and workflows on the SB platform is limited (particularly across 
lab divisions), tools will need to be built and imported by individuals. Resources will 
be posted here as we build new tools.

Contact the Core if you have any questions.
